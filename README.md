# Direct installations
We recommend downloading the following softwares :
* [R](https://www.r-project.org) : use any CRAN mirror for download
* [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) : see the download link, then choose the free version
* [Python](https://www.python.org) : select the version suggested once you move over the download tab
* [https://miktex.org](https://miktex.org) : see the download tab
These installations should be fine using the latest version for each software.

# RMarkdown installation
Once R and RStudio are installed, open the latter.
In the console, enter install.packages("rmarkdown") to install [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html).
