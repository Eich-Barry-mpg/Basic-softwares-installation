# Basic softwares installation
Lists the softwares any new member of MPG Partners might need and details the installation process.

# Direct installations
We recommend downloading the following softwares :
* [R](https://www.r-project.org): use any CRAN mirror for download
* [RStudio](https://rstudio.com): see the download link, then choose the free version
* [Python](https://www.python.org): select the version suggested once you move over the download tab
* [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org): see the download tab
* [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/downloads/)
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

Those installations should be fine using the latest (64 bits) version and the default settings for each software .
In case some issues are encountered, here are the detailed versions used as of January 2021 :
* R : [4.0.3](https://cran.rstudio.com)
* RStudio: [1.4.1103](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/release-notes/)
* Miktex: [21.1](https://miktex.org/download)

# RMarkdown
Once R and RStudio are installed, open the latter.
In the console, enter **install.packages("rmarkdown")** to install [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html).

# Python

## GitHub & Codpy (in case you don't already have access to the Github files)
* Download the Github zip file (will most likely be shared by email or drive)
* Then access Github>codpy>codpy : you will find two "codpy" files. Copy both of them.

# Utilization
To be completed.

## Miktex
Once Miktex is installed, launch TeXworks.
Check the well-functionning of the software by copying and pasting any sample (like this [one](https://tug.org/TUGboat/sampleart.ltx)) in the console, then launching the composition button (upper-left green triangle) : another TeXworks window should open, displaying the output of the code.
