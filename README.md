Lists the softwares any new member of MPG Partners might need to use and details the installation process.

# Direct installations
We recommend downloading the following softwares :
* [R](https://www.r-project.org): use any CRAN mirror for download
* [RStudio](https://rstudio.com): see the download link, then choose the free version
* [Python](https://www.python.org): select the version suggested once you move over the download tab
* [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org): see the download tab

These installations should be fine using the latest (64 bits) version for each software.
In case some issues are encountered, here are the detailed versions used as of January 2021 :
* R : [4.0.3](https://cran.rstudio.com)
* RStudio: [1.4.1103](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/release-notes/)

# RMarkdown installation
Once R and RStudio are installed, open the latter.
In the console, enter **install.packages("rmarkdown")** to install [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html).
